# YouTube Clone

This is a **YouTube Clone** project built to showcase my front-end development skills. It closely replicates YouTube's user interface using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project includes a homepage, video page, login page, and a stats page, all designed from scratch to mimic YouTube's features while showcasing my ability to work with front-end technologies.

> **Disclaimer**: This project is a non-commercial clone for educational and portfolio purposes only. It does not aim to replicate YouTube for monetization purposes. All YouTube video content, thumbnails, and logos are the property of **YouTube** and are used solely for demonstration purposes in this project. No content from YouTube is hosted or owned by me.

## Features

- **Homepage**: A YouTube-like main page, featuring a navigation bar, video thumbnails, and interactive elements.
- **Video Page**: A dedicated video page designed exactly like YouTube's video page. It includes a video player for the first video, with other videos embedded via YouTube's embed method. This page also includes sections for comments, related videos, and other YouTube-like features.
- **Login Page**: A login page without backend functionality. When the user clicks "Sign In" without entering their email, they are redirected to the homepage with a profile icon instead of the sign-in button.
- **Stats Page**: A custom-built stats page, not available in the original YouTube, that shows information like the most viewed video, most liked video, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content and layout of the pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a visually appealing, responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For handling user interactions (e.g., scroll alerts, sign-in flow, etc.) and managing the behavior of the pages.

## User Flow

1. **Homepage**: The homepage features a "Sign In" button in the navigation bar. When clicked, it takes the user to the login page.
2. **Login Page**: The login page asks the user for their email. If the user clicks the sign-in button without entering an email, they are redirected to the homepage, and the "Sign In" button is replaced with a profile icon in the navbar.
3. **Video Page**: The video page is a close clone of YouTube’s video page, designed entirely by me. It includes a video player for the first video (which works fully), and other videos are embedded using YouTube’s embed method. This page also replicates YouTube’s layout with sections for comments, related videos, and more.
4. **Stats Page**: This custom-built page shows various statistics like the most viewed and liked videos, providing additional features not available on the original YouTube site.
